<h1> Fast Flask </h1>

<h3> Abstract </h3>
<p>
This is an executable python file for creating an basic flask structure.
It allows you to save time in the boring part of your initial app and is very useful for newcomers.

Can be used for barely anyone, it's as simple as execute the file (yes, it's that simple)

It will create the files to you application, so you can just configure as you wish.

The 'app.py' includes basic imports from flask (Flask, render_template, redirect, etc..) and the very basic structure of the app.

It has an simple configurable db file named 'database.db' (sqlite3 as default, new technologies coming soon...)

First Step > Throw the file inside your preferable folder, my example folder will be "Example".

            + index.html
